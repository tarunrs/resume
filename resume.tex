\section{Research Projects}
\cventry{}{\small tCTR - Network attention predictor for tweets}{}{Prof. Srinivasan Parthasarathy}{}{Studied the effect of language semantics and sentiments in sparse data like tweets to predict network attention. Showed that using these lower dimensional language features contributed to network attention more than word based features or novelty of subject. }

\cventry{}{\small Realtime Analysis of Tweets}{}{Prof. Arnab Nandi}{}{Implemented a system for real-time analysis of sentiments and surfacing of contextual tweets related to political events like the Presidential debates. The supervised model achieves a precision of 65\% with a response time of less than 200ms on the 1\% Twitter firehose. }

\cventry{}{\small Link Prediction - KDD Cup 2012}{}{ Prof. Srinivasan Parthasarathy}{}{Part of a team of 3 that took part in the KDD Cup link prediction challenge in social networks. Wrote multiple scripts to extract semantic and network features from the social graph which helped achieve a weighted average precision of 81\%.}
 
\cventry{}{\small pSnipSuggest}{}{Prof. Arnab Nandi}{}{Implemented a system that provides on-the-go, context-aware assistance in the SQL composition process, based on SnipSuggest by  Khoussainova et al. Increased the average precision by 21\% and the response time by 30\% compared to the original implementation. Written in Python}
